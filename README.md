# pong with graphics.h library
The infamous 70s video-game pong recreated. It is a game like Ice Air Hockey. For 1st player, 'w' key is up and 's' key is down, 2nd player 'arrow_up' key is up and 'arrow_down' key is down. To run this program you should download and install graphics.h library to your IDE. 
Graphics.h library is a library that helps you to draw and colour pixels to create image. Animation can be created with the constant screen cleaning and building images.
If you somehow create a control-scheme which affects the next image (frame) you can create basic video-games like Pong.
